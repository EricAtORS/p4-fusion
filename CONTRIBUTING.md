# Contributing Guidelines

This project was started as a proof of concept for an internal project which required converting Perforce depots to Git repositories, hence, this project shall see only infrequent updates from the original authors.

However, this should not stop you from improving upon this tool in your own fork if you shall feel the need to do so. And if you are able to observe some performance improvements or fix some bugs then please consider contributing back to this repository by opening a PR. We also welcome you to open issues about any bugs that you find within this tool so that all the issues are documentated in a single place.
